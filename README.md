## Usage

Outgoing emails will be automatically copied to a local disk or table, but you can work with this package manually as well with the Emails facade:

```php
<?php
use Axyr\EmailViewer\Facades\Emails;

Emails::create($mimeMessage);
Emails::find($fileNameOrId);
Emails::delete($fileNameOrId);
Emails::paginate(10);
Emails::prune();
Emails::server('database')->get();
```

## Quick start

> This package requires the PECL [mailparse](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mailparse.php) extension

Run the composer install command from the terminal:

```php
composer require axyr/laravel-email-viewer
```

Publish the database migration and configuration file:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Axyr\EmailViewer\EmailViewerServiceProvider"
```

By default the package provides a set of routes for the Blade UI and the Vue UI. You can disabled them in the config file.

You can access the Blade UI by visiting:

```
https://your-host.tld/emails
```

```
